# Python API Challenge to be specific I guess

I do not know how to properly hide my API keys so I took them out entirely.  All my code is still in there to see along with the
results, but it's not gonna run without recreating the config files (with a working key) in the WeatherPy and VacationPy folders.
Sorry for that inconvenience!
